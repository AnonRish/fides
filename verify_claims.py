verify_claims.py -- programmatically checks this repository's own
documentation claims against what's actually on disk and against a fresh
test run. Run this yourself; don't take the README's word for it.

    python verify_claims.py

This script is itself part of the answer to "prove this is 100% done":
it draws the line, with evidence, between what's checkable and true
(every workstream examined, every cited file exists, tests pass) and
what "100% done" would actually require and doesn't have (physical
access, becoming part of an active production pipeline, full solutions
rather than the narrow slices this repo's own module docstrings admit
to). See the printed output's final section.
